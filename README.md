In this project I've implemented a pixel-perfect and responsive Landing Page for Nothing brand.
This web-site looks great on several devices: laptops, PC's, tablets and smartphones.

Technologies I've used here:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- SCSS (SASS preprocessor);
- BEM;
- media-queries;
- mixins, SCSS and CSS variables.
